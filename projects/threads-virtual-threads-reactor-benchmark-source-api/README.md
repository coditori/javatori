# Benchmarking Java Threads, Reactive Streams, and Virtual Threads
This project includes 3 endpoints to test reading a 6MB text file and returning it to the user. I'm using JMeter to benchmark performance with 10k, 100k, and 1 million requests. The JMeter test file is included in the project for easy setup.
